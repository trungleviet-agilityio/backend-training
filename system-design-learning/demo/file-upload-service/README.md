2. **Implement file encryption**
3. **Add file preview**
4. **Performance optimization**

## File Upload Flow

### Simple Upload
```
Client → API Server → Cloud Storage
```

### Resumable Upload
```
1. Client → API Server: Get upload URL
2. Client → Cloud Storage: Upload file chunks
3. Client → API Server: Complete upload
4. API Server → Database: Update metadata
```

### Block-Based Upload
```
1. Client → Block Server: Upload file
2. Block Server: Split → Compress → Encrypt
3. Block Server → Cloud Storage: Store blocks
4. API Server → Database: Store metadata
```

## API Endpoints

### File Operations
```
POST   /api/v1/files/upload          # Upload file
GET    /api/v1/files/{id}            # Get file info
GET    /api/v1/files/{id}/download   # Download file
PUT    /api/v1/files/{id}            # Update file
DELETE /api/v1/files/{id}            # Delete file
```

### File Management
```
GET    /api/v1/files                 # List user files
POST   /api/v1/files/{id}/share      # Share file
GET    /api/v1/files/{id}/versions   # Get file versions
POST   /api/v1/files/{id}/copy       # Copy file
```

### User Management
```
POST   /api/v1/auth/register         # User registration
POST   /api/v1/auth/login            # User login
GET    /api/v1/users/profile         # Get user profile
PUT    /api/v1/users/profile         # Update profile
```

## Technology Stack Suggestions

### Backend
- **Language**: Python (Django/Flask) or Node.js (Express)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ or Redis

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React, Vue.js, or Angular
- **File Upload**: Dropzone.js or similar
- **UI Library**: Material-UI, Ant Design, or Bootstrap

### Infrastructure
- **Container**: Docker
- **Cloud**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure
- **CDN**: CloudFront, Cloudflare, or similar
- **Load Balancer**: Nginx or cloud load balancer

## Key Concepts from Chapter 15

### Block-Based Storage
- **File Splitting**: Split large files into 4MB blocks
- **Delta Sync**: Only upload changed blocks
- **Compression**: Compress blocks based on file type
- **Encryption**: Encrypt blocks before storage

### Metadata Management
- **File Metadata**: Store file info, not file content
- **Block Mapping**: Map files to their blocks
- **Version Control**: Track file versions
- **User Permissions**: Manage file access

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed metadata
- **CDN**: Distribute popular files globally
- **Parallel Uploads**: Upload multiple blocks simultaneously
- **Resumable Uploads**: Handle network interruptions

## Security Considerations

### File Security
- **Encryption**: Encrypt files at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Implement proper file permissions
- **Virus Scanning**: Scan uploaded files for malware
- **File Validation**: Validate file types and sizes

### User Security
- **Authentication**: Secure user login
- **Authorization**: Proper access control
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse
- **Audit Logging**: Track file access

## Performance Considerations

### Upload Optimization
- **Chunked Uploads**: Upload large files in chunks
- **Parallel Processing**: Process multiple chunks simultaneously
- **Compression**: Reduce file sizes
- **Resumable Uploads**: Handle network failures

### Storage Optimization
- **Deduplication**: Eliminate duplicate files
- **Compression**: Compress files to save space
- **Tiered Storage**: Move old files to cheaper storage
- **CDN**: Cache popular files

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- File upload/download logic
- Authentication functions
- Database operations

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end file operations
- API endpoint testing
- Cloud storage integration

### Load Tests
- Concurrent file uploads
- Large file handling
- Database performance under load

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics
- **Upload Success Rate**: Percentage of successful uploads
- **Upload Speed**: Average upload time
- **Storage Usage**: Total storage consumed
- **User Activity**: Files uploaded per user

### Logging
- **Upload Logs**: Track file uploads
- **Error Logs**: Log upload failures
- **Access Logs**: Track file access
- **Performance Logs**: Monitor system performance

## Next Steps
1. Choose your technology stack
2. Set up development environment
3. Start with Phase 1 implementation
4. Add advanced features gradually
5. Implement security measures
6. Deploy and monitor
