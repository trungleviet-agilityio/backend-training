## Recommended Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. **Start with URL Shortener** - Learn basic system design concepts
2. **Study the corresponding chapter** from the book
3. **Implement core features** first, then add advanced features

### Phase 2: Intermediate
1. **Move to Notification System** - Learn about message queues
2. **Practice with File Upload Service** - Understand file processing
3. **Focus on scalability** and performance optimization

### Phase 3: Advanced
1. **Tackle Chat System** - Master real-time communication
2. **Implement all advanced features**
3. **Focus on production readiness**

## Technology Stack Recommendations

### For Beginners
- **Backend**: Python (Flask) or Node.js (Express)
- **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript or React
- **Deployment**: Heroku or Railway

### For Intermediate
- **Backend**: Python (Django) or Node.js (Express)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis cache
- **Message Queue**: Redis or RabbitMQ
- **Frontend**: React or Vue.js
- **Deployment**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure

### For Advanced
- **Backend**: Microservices architecture
- **Database**: Multiple databases (SQL + NoSQL)
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD

## Common System Design Patterns

### Data Storage
- **Relational Databases**: For structured data and ACID transactions
- **NoSQL Databases**: For scalability and flexible schemas
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Object Storage**: For file storage (S3, Cloud Storage)

### Communication
- **REST APIs**: For synchronous communication
- **Message Queues**: For asynchronous processing
- **WebSockets**: For real-time bidirectional communication
- **Event Streaming**: For high-throughput data processing

### Scalability
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across servers
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more servers to handle load
- **Database Sharding**: Distribute data across multiple databases
- **CDN**: Distribute static content globally

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic programming knowledge (Python, JavaScript, or similar)
- Understanding of databases (SQL)
- Familiarity with web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Knowledge of REST APIs

### Setup Instructions
1. **Choose a project** based on your skill level
2. **Read the project README** for detailed requirements
3. **Study the corresponding chapter** from the book
4. **Set up your development environment**
5. **Start with Phase 1** implementation
6. **Gradually add advanced features**

### Development Tips
- **Start simple**: Begin with basic functionality
- **Incremental development**: Add features one by one
- **Test thoroughly**: Write tests for each component
- **Document your decisions**: Keep notes on design choices
- **Monitor performance**: Use tools to measure system performance

## Evaluation Criteria

### Technical Implementation
- **Functionality**: Does the system work as expected?
- **Performance**: Can it handle the expected load?
- **Scalability**: Can it scale to handle more users/data?
- **Reliability**: Does it handle failures gracefully?

### Code Quality
- **Clean code**: Is the code readable and maintainable?
- **Testing**: Are there adequate tests?
- **Documentation**: Is the code well-documented?
- **Error handling**: Are errors handled properly?

### System Design
- **Architecture**: Is the system well-architected?
- **Trade-offs**: Are design decisions justified?
- **Scalability**: Can the system scale horizontally?
- **Security**: Are security considerations addressed?
