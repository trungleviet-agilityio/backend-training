# Chapter 1: The Architect's Hit List

## ðŸ“– Summary

This chapter introduces the fundamental problem with current software development practices and presents a comprehensive "hit list" of considerations that must be addressed in software architecture.

### The Tour Operator Project Failure (2004)
- **Project Scope:** Replace legacy system with new travel booking solution
- **Complexity Factors:**
  - Large variety of travel options
  - Non-standard vendor contracts
  - Multiple packaging variants
  - Daily pricing changes based on availability, demand, seasonality
- **Process Timeline:**
  - 10 months gathering requirements
  - 3 months architecture planning
  - Initial estimate: 2 years, 30 engineers, 8-digit budget
- **Actual Result:** 8 years, 6x budget overrun, outdated upon completion
- **Root Cause:** Focused only on functional requirements, ignored operational concerns

### The Fundamental Flaw in Software Development
- **Current Practice:** Collect functional requirements and build around them
- **Problem:** Ignores non-functional concerns (maintainability, scalability, operational efficiency)
- **Result:** Systems that are "drivable but impossible to fix"
- **Pattern:** The "rewrite" cycle - repeatedly rebuilding systems without addressing fundamental issues

### Automotive Industry Comparison
- **Comprehensive Approach:** Automakers consider all aspects beyond just drivability
- **Key Considerations:**
  - Maintainability by third parties (independent mechanics, dealerships)
  - Parts interchangeability (independent body shops)
  - Assembly line efficiency (quick and inexpensive assembly)
  - Quality control (error detection and prevention)
  - Production flexibility (switching between car models)
- **Software Lesson:** We should think the same way about software architecture

### The "Rewrite" Cycle Problem
- **Pattern:** Build â†’ Suffer â†’ Propose Rewrite â†’ Repeat Same Mistakes
- **Causes:**
  - Focus only on functional requirements
  - Ignore non-functional concerns
  - Don't architect the "assembly line" for efficient implementation
- **Impact:** Wastes resources, creates technical debt, slows innovation

### The Architect's Hit List (20 Items)

#### Technical Considerations
- Programming languages, their features, readability, and interoperation
- Code reuse across platforms (server vs web vs mobile)
- Early error detection (compile-time vs runtime error detection, breadth of validation)
- Readability and refactorability of code
- Approach to code composition, embracing the change

#### Human & Operational Factors
- Availability and cost of hiring the right talent; learning curve for new hires
- Enabling multiple concurrent development workstreams
- Enabling testability
- Fast-tracking development by adopting third-party frameworks

#### Data & Performance
- Datastore and general approach to data modeling
- Application-specific data model, and the blast radius from changing it
- Performance and latency in all tiers and platforms
- Scalability and redundancy
- Spiky traffic patterns, autoscaling, capacity planning

#### Reliability & Operations
- Error recovery
- Logging, telemetry, and other instrumentation
- Reducing complexity
- Hardware and human costs of the infrastructure and its maintenance

#### User Experience & Security
- User interfaces and their maintainability
- External APIs
- User identity and security

### Key Principles
1. **Architecture Must Address Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Beyond just what the system should do
   - Consider how it will be built, maintained, and operated

2. **Consider Everything Before Writing Code**
   - Have answers to all hit list items before implementation
   - Make fundamentally correct choices early

3. **Avoid the Functional-Only Trap**
   - Don't just collect functional requirements
   - Invest in architecting the "assembly line" for efficient implementation

4. **The Hit List is a Starting Point**
   - Your list might be larger
   - Reflect on it and expand as needed
   - Ensure your architecture addresses every concern

### Book's Promise
- The rest of the book provides recipes and design patterns to address the hit list
- Solutions may address multiple items or provide partial answers
- As a whole, will provide comprehensive coverage of all concerns
