# Chapter 15: Batch

## ðŸ“– Summary

This chapter discusses batch processing in software systems, its use cases, design patterns, and best practices for reliability, scalability, and efficiency.

### What is Batch Processing?
- **Definition:** Executing a series of jobs or tasks without manual intervention, often on large volumes of data.
- **Goal:** Automate repetitive, resource-intensive, or time-consuming tasks.

### Batch Processing Use Cases
- **Data Transformation:** ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs for analytics.
- **Billing and Invoicing:** Generating monthly statements.
- **Reporting:** Nightly or periodic report generation.
- **Data Migration:** Moving or transforming large datasets.

### Batch Architecture Patterns
- **Job Scheduler:** Orchestrates job execution (cron, Airflow, etc.).
- **Worker Pools:** Multiple workers process jobs in parallel.
- **Checkpointing:** Save progress to resume after failure.
- **Retry and Recovery:** Handle failures and retries automatically.

### Best Practices
- **Idempotency:** Ensure jobs can be safely retried.
- **Monitoring:** Track job status, failures, and performance.
- **Resource Management:** Control CPU, memory, and I/O usage.
- **Logging:** Detailed logs for auditing and troubleshooting.
- **Alerting:** Notify operators of failures or delays.

### Key Principles
1. **Automate Everything:** Minimize manual intervention.
2. **Design for Failure:** Plan for retries and recovery.
3. **Optimize for Throughput:** Use parallelism and resource management.
4. **Monitor Continuously:** Track and alert on job health.
5. **Document Workflows:** Keep job definitions and dependencies clear.

## Review Questions
1. What is batch processing and when is it used?
2. What are common batch processing patterns?
3. How do you ensure idempotency in batch jobs?
4. What tools help with job scheduling and orchestration?
5. How do you monitor and alert on batch jobs?
6. What are the risks of resource contention?
7. How do you handle failures and retries?
8. What is checkpointing and why is it important?
9. How do you document and manage batch workflows?
10. What are common anti-patterns in batch processing?

## Key Concepts

### Example: Cron Job
```cron
0 2 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /app/scripts/generate_report.py
```

### Example: Idempotent Batch Job
```python
def process_record(record_id):
    if already_processed(record_id):
        return
    # ... process ...
    mark_as_processed(record_id)
```

## Pros & Cons

### Pros
- Efficient for large-scale, repetitive tasks
- Can be scheduled during off-peak hours
- Supports automation and reliability

### Cons
- Not suitable for real-time needs
- Can cause resource spikes

## Real-World Applications
- **Banking:** End-of-day processing
- **E-commerce:** Inventory reconciliation
- **Telecom:** Billing cycles

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Design a Batch Workflow
**Task:** Create a workflow for nightly data aggregation.

### Exercise 2: Implement Checkpointing
**Task:** Add checkpointing to a long-running batch job.

## Questions & Doubts

### Questions for Clarification
1. How do you balance batch and real-time processing?
2. What tools help visualize batch workflows?

### Areas Needing More Research
- Advanced job orchestration frameworks
- Batch processing in cloud-native environments

## Summary

### Key Takeaways
1. Batch processing automates large-scale, repetitive tasks.
2. Use idempotency, monitoring, and automation for reliability.
3. Document and optimize batch workflows for efficiency.

### Next Steps
- [ ] Review your batch processing jobs.
