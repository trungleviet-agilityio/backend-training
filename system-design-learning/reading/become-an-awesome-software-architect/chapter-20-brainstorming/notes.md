# Chapter 20: Brainstorming

## ðŸ“– Summary

This chapter introduces the Disney Method for brainstorming and decision-making, emphasizing the importance of separating idea generation, planning, and criticism. The method, originally developed at Walt Disney Studios, helps teams avoid prematurely discarding valuable ideas and ensures a thorough evaluation of both creative concepts and execution plans. The chapter also adapts the method for software architecture, highlighting how to iterate between product specification, architectural planning, and critical review.

### The Disney Method
- **Three Roles:** Dreamers (idea generation), Realists (planning), Critics (evaluation).
- **Process:** Ideas are generated without constraints, execution plans are developed without immediate concern for cost or complexity, and only the plansâ€”not the original ideasâ€”are criticized.
- **Iteration:** If criticism is significant, the process loops back to idea generation for revision; if not, the plan is ready for implementation.

### Adaptation to Software Architecture
- **Dream:** Product management creates an unconstrained product specification.
- **Plan:** Architects design the best possible architecture for the specification.
- **Critique:** The whole team reviews the architecture for risks, costs, and feasibility, but never criticizes the product vision directly.
- **Feedback Loop:** Criticism leads to either revising the product spec or moving forward with implementation.

### Key Diagrams
- **Original Disney Method:** (See attached diagram) Illustrates the flow between Dreamers, Realists, and Critics, including the feedback and decision points.
- **Software Adaptation:** (See attached diagram) Maps the process to Product Management, Architects, and Everyone (critics), showing how product specs and architectures are iteratively refined.

## Key Principles
1. **Separate Roles:** Never mix idea generation, planning, and criticism in the same step.
2. **No Early Elimination:** Avoid discarding ideas before fully exploring their potential.
3. **Criticize Plans, Not Dreams:** Only execution plans are subject to criticism, not the original vision.
4. **Iterate:** Use feedback to refine both the product and its architecture.
5. **Context Switching:** Ensure clear separation of roles, even if performed by the same individuals.

## Review Questions
1. What are the three roles in the Disney Method?
2. Why is it important not to criticize ideas during the brainstorming phase?
3. How does the Disney Method help avoid systemic mistakes in decision-making?
4. How is the Disney Method adapted for software architecture?
5. What should be done if significant criticism is raised during the review phase?

## Key Concepts

### Example: Disney Method Flow
- **Dreamers:** Generate all possible ideas, no matter how wild.
- **Realists:** Develop detailed execution plans for each idea.
- **Critics:** Evaluate plans for risks, costs, and feasibility.

### Example: Software Architecture Adaptation
- **Product Mgmt:** Defines the ideal product spec.
- **Architects:** Design the best architecture for the spec.
- **Everyone:** Critiques the architecture, not the product vision.

## Pros & Cons

### Pros
- Encourages creativity and thorough analysis.
- Reduces risk of missing valuable ideas.
- Provides a structured feedback loop.

### Cons
- Can be time-consuming if not managed well.
- Requires discipline to keep roles and steps separate.

## Real-World Applications
- **Product Development:** Ensuring all options are considered before committing to a plan.
- **Software Architecture:** Iteratively refining specs and architectures for complex systems.
- **Team Brainstorming:** Facilitating creative and critical thinking in any domain.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Run a Disney Method Session
**Task:** Facilitate a brainstorming session using the three-room approach for a new product or feature.

### Exercise 2: Critique an Architecture
**Task:** Review an existing architecture using the critic role, then provide feedback to revise the original spec.

## Questions & Doubts

### Questions for Clarification
1. How do you ensure strict separation of roles in small teams?
2. What tools can help document the iterative process?

### Areas Needing More Research
- Techniques for effective context switching.
- Case studies of the Disney Method in software projects.

## Summary

### Key Takeaways
1. The Disney Method structures brainstorming into idea generation, planning, and criticism.
2. Never criticize ideas prematurely; only critique execution plans.
3. Iterative feedback leads to better products and architectures.

### Next Steps
- [ ] Try the Disney Method in your next brainstorming session.
- [ ] Document the process and outcomes for future reference.
- [ ] Explore adaptations for remote or asynchronous teams.
