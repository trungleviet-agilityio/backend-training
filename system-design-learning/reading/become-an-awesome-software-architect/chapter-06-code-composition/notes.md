# Chapter 6: Code Composition

## ðŸ“– Summary

This chapter explores the principles and patterns of code composition in software architecture, focusing on how to build systems from smaller, reusable components for maintainability, testability, and scalability.

### What is Code Composition?
- **Definition:** The process of building complex systems by combining smaller, well-defined components or modules.
- **Goal:** Achieve modularity, reusability, and separation of concerns.

### Composition Patterns
- **Function Composition:** Building complex logic by combining simple functions.
- **Object Composition:** Creating objects from smaller objects or traits (favor composition over inheritance).
- **Service Composition:** Combining microservices or APIs to deliver business capabilities.
- **Pipeline Composition:** Chaining processing steps (e.g., middleware, data processing pipelines).

### Benefits of Code Composition
- **Reusability:** Components can be reused across different parts of the system.
- **Testability:** Smaller units are easier to test in isolation.
- **Maintainability:** Changes in one component have minimal impact on others.
- **Scalability:** Components can be scaled independently if needed.
- **Flexibility:** Easy to replace or upgrade individual components.

### Best Practices for Code Composition
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each component should do one thing well.
- **Loose Coupling:** Minimize dependencies between components.
- **Explicit Interfaces:** Define clear contracts for how components interact.
- **Dependency Injection:** Pass dependencies explicitly to improve testability and flexibility.
- **Immutability:** Favor immutable data structures for safer composition.

### Code Composition Anti-Patterns
- **God Object:** One object does too much, violating modularity.
- **Tight Coupling:** Components are overly dependent on each other.
- **Hidden Dependencies:** Dependencies are not explicit, making code hard to understand.
- **Overuse of Inheritance:** Inheritance chains make code rigid and hard to change.

### Composition in Modern Architectures
- **Functional Programming:** Emphasizes pure functions and composition.
- **Component-Based UI:** Frameworks like React use component composition for UIs.
- **Microservices:** Services are composed to build larger systems.
- **Middleware:** Web frameworks use middleware composition for request handling.

### Key Principles
1. **Favor Composition Over Inheritance:** Prefer building systems from small, composable units.
2. **Keep Components Small and Focused:** Easier to test, maintain, and reuse.
3. **Make Dependencies Explicit:** Use dependency injection and clear interfaces.
4. **Design for Change:** Components should be easy to replace or upgrade.
5. **Document Component Contracts:** Make it clear how components interact.

## Review Questions

10. Why is explicit interface definition important?

## Key Concepts

### Example: Function Composition in JavaScript
```javascript
const add = x => y => x + y;
const multiply = x => y => x * y;
const addThenMultiply = (a, b, c) => multiply(c)(add(a)(b));
// addThenMultiply(2, 3, 4) => (2 + 3) * 4 = 20
```

### Example: Dependency Injection
```python
class EmailService:
    def send(self, to, subject, body):
        pass

class NotificationManager:
    def __init__(self, email_service):
        self.email_service = email_service
    def notify(self, user, message):
        self.email_service.send(user.email, "Notification", message)
```

## Pros & Cons

### Pros
- Modular and reusable code
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Flexible and adaptable systems

### Cons
- Too many small components can increase complexity
- Overhead in managing dependencies

## Real-World Applications
- **React/Vue Components:** UI built from reusable components
- **Express/Koa Middleware:** Web request pipelines
- **Microservices:** Composing business capabilities from services

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Refactor for Composition
**Task:** Refactor a class with many responsibilities into smaller, composable functions or objects.

### Exercise 2: Implement Dependency Injection
**Task:** Rewrite a tightly coupled module to use dependency injection.

## Questions & Doubts

### Questions for Clarification
1. How do you balance granularity and complexity in composition?
2. What tools help visualize component dependencies?

### Areas Needing More Research
- Advanced patterns for large-scale composition
- Automated tools for dependency management

## Summary

### Key Takeaways
1. Code composition enables modular, maintainable, and testable systems.
2. Favor composition over inheritance and keep components small.
3. Make dependencies explicit and use clear interfaces.
