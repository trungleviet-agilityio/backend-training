# Chapter 2: Programming Languages

## ðŸ“– Summary

This chapter discusses the critical importance of programming language selection in software architecture and provides a systematic approach to evaluating languages based on business needs rather than personal preferences.

### The Business Perspective on Language Choice
- **Personal vs Business:** Personal favorites are acceptable, but business decisions must be 100% logical
- **First Choice:** Programming language selection affects everything in a project
- **Objective Approach:** Must put feelings aside and use cold, heartless selection process

### Key Language Characteristics for Evaluation

#### Strong Static Typing
- **Definition:** Language imposes strict restrictions on intermixing values of different data types
- **Benefits:** Catches type-related bugs early, pinpoints root causes
- **Example Problem:** JavaScript allows string + number operations, leading to unexpected results
- **Solution:** TypeScript provides compile-time error detection
- **Critical Requirement:** Both strong typing AND static type checking for reliable code

#### Explicitly Defined Data Structures
- **Definition:** Language's ability to define data structures and validate compliance at compile time
- **Benefits:** Catches structural errors early, accelerates development, creates stable software
- **Example:** TypeScript interfaces catch typos in object properties at compile time
- **IDE Support:** Modern IDEs provide real-time error highlighting and code completion

#### Support for Interfaces
- **Purpose:** Creates abstraction/contract for data structures or classes
- **Benefits:** Enables Dependency Injection pattern and Dependency Inversion Principle
- **Example:** Function can work with any logger implementation as long as it follows the interface
- **Alternative:** Abstract classes in languages without interface support (like Python)

#### Isomorphism
- **Definition:** Language's ability to run across multiple platforms
- **Three Levels:**
  - **Native:** Works on all platforms natively (e.g., JavaScript)
  - **Transpiled:** Cross-compiled into natively isomorphic language (e.g., TypeScript â†’ JavaScript)
  - **Generated:** Generates platform-specific code independently (e.g., Kotlin)
- **Best Options:** Native and Transpiled isomorphism are sufficient for most projects

#### Third-Party Libraries
- **Impact:** Choice affects ability to use pre-existing solutions
- **Best Supported:** JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Python
- **Consideration:** More "esoteric" languages may require writing additional code

#### Ease of Refactoring
- **Definition:** Restructuring existing code without changing external behavior
- **Importance:** Essential for architecture changes and data model migrations
- **Best Support:** Compiled languages with strong static type checking
- **Examples:** Java (excellent), Python/PHP (weak)

#### Functional vs Object-Oriented Programming
- **OOP Approach:** Objects with state, encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces
- **FP Approach:** Separate data and behaviors, stateless, pure functions
- **When to Use OOP:** Modeling real-life objects with self-contained behaviors
- **When FP Works Better:** Complex interactions between multiple objects
- **Modern Trend:** Most languages support both paradigms to varying degrees
- **Recommendation:** Use best of both worlds - interfaces from OOP, pure functions from FP

#### Human Factors
- **Ease of Hiring:** Consider job market and cost (Python engineers cheaper than Java)
- **Learning Curve:** How quickly can new hires become productive
- **Readability:** How easily business logic can be discerned from code

### Language Comparison Table

| Language | Explicit Data Structures | Strong Static Typing | Interfaces | Isomorphism | OOP vs FP | Third Party Libraries | Refactoring | Hiring | Learning Curve | Readability |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|-------------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Java | Yes | Yes | Yes | Generated | OOP first | Many | Strong | Expensive | Medium | Great |
| Kotlin | Yes | Yes | Yes | Generated | OOP first | Few | Strong | Expensive, hard to find | Steep | Medium |
| JavaScript | No | No | No | Native | FP first | Many | Weak | Inexpensive, easy to find | Flat | Medium |
| TypeScript | Yes | Yes | Yes | Transpiled | FP first + interfaces | Many | Medium | Inexpensive, easy to find | Flat | Medium |
| Python | No | No | No | No | OOP first | Many | Weak | Inexpensive, easy to find | Flat | Poor |

### Use Case Recommendations

#### Strictly Optimize for Cost and Time
- **Server:** TypeScript
- **Web:** TypeScript with React/Redux
- **Mobile:** Cordova hybrid apps (shared code)

#### Maximize Server Reliability, Then Optimize Cost & Time
- **Server:** Java (consider Kotlin/Scala as expensive options)
- **Web:** TypeScript with React/Redux
- **Mobile:** Cordova hybrid apps
- **Communication:** Protobufs IDL

#### Provide Smooth Native Mobile Experience, Then Optimize Cost & Time
- **Server:** TypeScript
- **Web:** TypeScript with React/Redux
- **Mobile:** React Native or Flutter/Dart (shared code)

#### Maximize Server Reliability + Native Mobile Experience, Then Optimize Cost & Time
- **Server:** Java (consider Kotlin/Scala)
- **Web:** TypeScript with React/Redux
- **Mobile:** React Native or Flutter/Dart
- **Communication:** Protobufs IDL

### Key Principles
1. **Business Logic Over Personal Preference:** Language choice must be based on business needs
2. **Strong Static Typing is Essential:** For reliable, bug-free code
3. **Consider the Complete Ecosystem:** Libraries, tooling, hiring, learning curve
4. **Isomorphism Matters:** For cross-platform development efficiency
5. **Refactoring Support is Critical:** For long-term maintainability
