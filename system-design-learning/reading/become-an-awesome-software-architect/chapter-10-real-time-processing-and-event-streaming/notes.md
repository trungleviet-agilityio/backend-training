# Chapter 10: Real-Time Processing and Event Streaming

## ðŸ“– Summary

This chapter explores real-time processing and event streaming in modern software systems, their use cases, architectural patterns, and best practices for building responsive, scalable, and decoupled systems.

### What is Real-Time Processing?
- **Definition:** Processing data and events as they occur, with minimal delay.
- **Goal:** Provide immediate feedback, actions, or insights based on incoming data.

### What is Event Streaming?
- **Definition:** Continuous flow of events/messages between producers and consumers.
- **Event:** A record of a change or action in the system (e.g., user action, sensor reading).
- **Streaming Platform:** Middleware (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) that manages event delivery.

### Use Cases
- **Analytics:** Real-time dashboards, monitoring, fraud detection.
- **Notifications:** Instant alerts, messaging, push notifications.
- **IoT:** Sensor data processing, device control.
- **Microservices:** Decoupled communication between services.
- **ETL Pipelines:** Real-time data ingestion and transformation.

### Architectural Patterns
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Components communicate via events, enabling loose coupling.
- **Stream Processing:** Continuous computation on data streams (e.g., Apache Flink, Spark Streaming).
- **CQRS + Event Sourcing:** Commands generate events, state is rebuilt from event streams.
- **Publish-Subscribe:** Producers publish events, multiple consumers subscribe and react.

### Benefits
- **Low Latency:** Immediate processing and response.
- **Scalability:** Easily add new consumers or processing steps.
- **Decoupling:** Producers and consumers evolve independently.
- **Resilience:** Systems can recover by replaying event streams.

### Challenges
- **Event Ordering:** Ensuring correct sequence of events.
- **Exactly-Once Processing:** Avoiding duplicates or missed events.
- **Backpressure:** Handling spikes in event volume.
- **Schema Evolution:** Managing changes to event formats.
- **Monitoring:** Observability across distributed event flows.

### Best Practices
- **Idempotency:** Ensure event handlers can safely process the same event multiple times.
- **Replayability:** Design systems to replay events for recovery or new consumers.
- **Schema Management:** Use versioned schemas for events.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Track lag, throughput, and failures.
- **Backpressure Handling:** Use buffering, rate limiting, or scaling.

### Key Principles
1. **Design for Decoupling:** Use events to reduce direct dependencies.
2. **Embrace Asynchrony:** Accept that not all processing is instant.
3. **Plan for Failure:** Systems should recover from missed or out-of-order events.
4. **Monitor Continuously:** Track event flow and system health.
5. **Document Event Contracts:** Clearly define event formats and semantics.

## Review Questions

## Key Concepts

### Example: Event Handler Idempotency
```python
def handle_event(event):
    if event_already_processed(event.id):
        return
    process(event)
    mark_event_processed(event.id)
```

### Example: Kafka Consumer
```python
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
consumer = KafkaConsumer('events', bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'])
for message in consumer:
    process_event(message.value)
```

## Pros & Cons

### Pros
- Immediate feedback and actions
- Scalable and decoupled systems
- Supports analytics and monitoring

### Cons
- Increased complexity
- Event ordering and delivery guarantees
- Monitoring and debugging distributed flows

## Real-World Applications
- **Financial Trading:** Real-time market data and order processing
- **Social Media:** Live feeds, notifications
- **IoT Platforms:** Sensor data ingestion and control

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Design an Event-Driven System
**Task:** Sketch an architecture for a real-time notification service.

### Exercise 2: Implement Idempotent Event Handling
**Task:** Write code to ensure event handlers are idempotent.

## Questions & Doubts

### Questions for Clarification
1. How do you ensure exactly-once processing in distributed systems?
2. What tools are best for monitoring event streams?

### Areas Needing More Research
