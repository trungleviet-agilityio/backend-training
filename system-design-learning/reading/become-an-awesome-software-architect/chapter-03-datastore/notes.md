# Chapter 3: Datastore

## ðŸ“– Summary

This chapter addresses the fundamental question of system component dependencies through a team discussion and introduces proper datastore architecture patterns that support business logic changes rather than constraining them.

### The Team Discussion: Dependency Puzzle
- **Scenario:** Team asked to determine dependencies between three components (UI, Business Logic, Datastore)
- **Tom's Initial Answer:** UI depends on Business Logic, Business Logic depends on Datastore
- **Team's Reasoning:** "Datastore is hardest to change, so Business Logic must depend on it"
- **The Trap:** Team fell into thinking Datastore should be the most stable component
- **Correct Answer:** Both UI and Datastore must depend on Business Logic
- **Key Insight:** Business Logic is the core value-generating component; everything else serves it

### Dependency Definition
- **Component A depends on Component B** if changes to B may trigger changes to A
- **Code Expression:** Import statements, interfaces, classes, or functions from Component B
- **Correct Architecture:** Datastore imports from Business Logic, not vice versa

### The Dependency Inversion Solution

#### Incorrect Implementation (Business Logic depends on Datastore)
```typescript
// module datastore.ts
export interface UserProfile {
    userId: string;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
};
export const readUserProfile = (userId: string): UserProfile => {
    // read user from the database
};

// module business-logic.ts
import { readUserProfile, UserProfile } from './datastore';
const printUser = (userId: string): void => {
    let user: UserProfile = readUserProfile(userId);
    console.log(`user: ${user.userId} ${user.firstName}`);
};
```

#### Correct Implementation (Datastore depends on Business Logic)
```typescript
// module business-logic-defs.ts
export interface UserProfile {
    userId: string;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
};
export interface UserDataAccess {
    readUserProfile(userId: string): UserProfile;
};

// module business-logic-impl.ts
import { UserDataAccess, UserProfile } from './business-logic-defs';
const printUser = (da: UserDataAccess, userId: string): void => {
    let user: UserProfile = da.readUserProfile(userId);
    console.log(`user: ${user.userId} ${user.firstName}`);
};

// module datastore.ts
import { UserDataAccess, UserProfile } from './business-logic-defs';
export class UserDataAccessImpl implements UserDataAccess {
    readUserProfile(userId: string): UserProfile {
        // read user from the database
    }
};
```

### Data Persistence Patterns

#### CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **Definition:** Traditional approach maintaining current application state in datastore
- **Origin:** Days of scarce computing resources, limited disk space, slow databases
- **Example:** Shopping cart as set of records (Cart and CartItem tables)
- **Problem:** Inherent design flaw - same data structure for all operations
- **Specific Issues:**
  - Must update Cart record every time CartItem is manipulated (inefficient)
  - totalPrice should be excluded and recomputed
  - price for CartItem could be calculated automatically
  - cartItemId could be auto-generated
  - Limiting updates breaks traditional CRUD paradigm

#### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- **Definition:** Two separate data models instead of one
- **Query Model:** Responsible for data retrieval (Read action from CRUD)
- **Command Model:** Manipulates data by processing commands
- **Benefits:**
  - Separate models for different operations
  - Commands accept only relevant data
  - Clearer interfaces
  - More flexible than CRUD
  - totalPrice and price available from Query Model only (calculated)
  - Different commands accept only relevant data

#### Event Store Pattern
- **Definition:** Stores all commands/events directly in database
- **Alternative Names:** Command Store, Immutable Store
- **Key Principle:** Only events are recorded, not current state
- **Operation Mode:** Append-only (immutable)
- **State Reconstruction:** Query Model rebuilds state by "replaying" events
- **Implementation:** Commands through Command Model stored directly in database

### Event Store Benefits
- **Natural Fit:** Banking (credits/debits), accounting (immutable transactions)
- **Reliability:** Complete transaction history always available
- **Flexibility:** Same events can construct different application states
- **Scalability:** Better performance, less locking, fewer transaction isolation issues
- **Storage Options:** Beyond traditional relational engines
- **Business Examples:** Banking data with credits/debits, accounting data models

### Event Store Practical Considerations
- **Event Filtering:** Query Model doesn't need entire history, only relevant events
- **Example:** Shopping cart only needs events for specific cart/user since last order
- **Multiple Views:** Same events can construct different application states
- **Use Cases:** Online users, business intelligence, accounting
- **Flexibility:** Modify model without restructuring stored data

### Performance Optimization: Snapshot Builder
- **Problem:** Query Model processing too many events affects performance
- **Example:** Bank looking at 10 years of transactions just to show balance
- **Solution:** Asynchronous Snapshot Builder creates periodic state snapshots
- **Process:**
  1. Snapshot Builder creates persistent state periodically
  2. Query Model reads latest snapshot
  3. Updates with events after snapshot creation
  4. Serves final current state to Business Logic
- **Benefits:** Query Model only processes recent events
- **Flexibility:** Multiple snapshot stores for different purposes
- **Compatibility:** Full application state in relational database enables third-party tools (reporting, analytics, ETL)

### Key Architectural Principles
1. **Business Logic is King:** Everything serves the business logic, not the other way around
2. **Dependency Inversion:** Datastore must depend on Business Logic
3. **Event Store Flexibility:** Allows model changes without data restructuring
4. **Performance Balance:** Snapshots optimize event processing
5. **Immutable Data:** Append-only approach for reliability and audit trails
6. **NoSQL Limitation:** Schema-less databases are a band-aid, not a real solution

### Pattern Selection Guidelines
- **Ditch CRUD:** In favor of CQRS for better flexibility
- **Consider Event Store:** For systems requiring audit trails and flexibility
- **Use Snapshots:** When performance becomes an issue with pure event sourcing
- **Multiple Models:** Different views for different purposes (online users, BI, accounting)
- **Snapshot Rebuilding:** Can be rebuilt anytime if data model changes
