# Chapter 16: Multi-Tenancy

## ðŸ“– Summary

This chapter explores multi-tenancy in software systems, its architectural models, benefits, challenges, and best practices for secure and efficient tenant isolation.

### What is Multi-Tenancy?
- **Definition:** A single software instance serves multiple customers (tenants), each with isolated data and configuration.
- **Goal:** Maximize resource utilization while providing tenant-specific experiences.

### Multi-Tenancy Models
- **Shared Database, Shared Schema:** All tenants share the same tables, with tenant IDs for isolation.
- **Shared Database, Separate Schemas:** Each tenant has a separate schema within the same database.
- **Separate Databases:** Each tenant has a dedicated database instance.

### Benefits of Multi-Tenancy
- **Cost Efficiency:** Shared infrastructure reduces costs.
- **Scalability:** Easily onboard new tenants.
- **Centralized Management:** Easier updates and maintenance.
- **Customization:** Tenant-specific features and branding.

### Challenges of Multi-Tenancy
- **Data Isolation:** Prevent data leaks between tenants.
- **Performance:** Avoid noisy neighbor effects.
- **Security:** Enforce strict access controls.
- **Complexity:** More complex code and operations.

### Best Practices
- **Strong Tenant Isolation:** Use tenant IDs, access controls, and schema separation.
- **Monitoring:** Track usage and performance per tenant.
- **Resource Quotas:** Prevent one tenant from consuming excessive resources.
- **Customizability:** Allow tenant-specific settings and features.
- **Automated Provisioning:** Streamline onboarding and scaling.

### Key Principles
1. **Isolate by Default:** Assume tenants should never see each other's data.
2. **Monitor Per Tenant:** Track metrics and issues at the tenant level.
3. **Automate Management:** Use automation for provisioning, scaling, and updates.
4. **Plan for Scale:** Design for thousands of tenants from the start.
5. **Secure Everything:** Apply security best practices at every layer.

## Review Questions
1. What is multi-tenancy and why is it used?
2. What are the main models of multi-tenancy?
3. How do you ensure data isolation between tenants?
4. What are the benefits and challenges of multi-tenancy?
5. How do you monitor and manage tenant usage?
6. What are resource quotas and why are they important?
7. How do you handle tenant-specific customization?
8. What are common security risks in multi-tenant systems?
9. How do you automate tenant provisioning?
10. What are anti-patterns in multi-tenant architecture?

## Key Concepts

### Example: Tenant ID Filtering
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE tenant_id = 'tenant123';
```

### Example: Resource Quota Enforcement
```python
if tenant_usage > tenant_quota:
    raise Exception("Quota exceeded")
```

## Pros & Cons

### Pros
- Cost savings and efficiency
- Centralized management
- Scalable onboarding

### Cons
- Increased complexity
- Risk of data leakage

## Real-World Applications
- **SaaS Platforms:** Serve many customers from a single codebase
- **Cloud Services:** Multi-tenant infrastructure for cost efficiency

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Design a Multi-Tenant Schema
**Task:** Create a schema for a SaaS app supporting multiple tenants.

### Exercise 2: Implement Tenant Isolation
**Task:** Add tenant ID filtering to all data access code.

## Questions & Doubts

### Questions for Clarification
1. How do you migrate tenants between models?
2. What tools help monitor multi-tenant systems?

### Areas Needing More Research
- Tenant-aware monitoring and alerting
- Automated tenant provisioning tools

## Summary

### Key Takeaways
1. Multi-tenancy enables efficient, scalable SaaS platforms.
2. Isolate, monitor, and automate for secure, reliable operation.
3. Plan for scale and customization from the start.
