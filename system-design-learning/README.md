# System Design Learning

This section helps trainees understand the foundation of system design principles and practices.

## Learning Plan

### Theory üìö

**Core Resources:**
- **"Become an Awesome Software Architect"** - Anatoly Volkhover
- **"System Design Interview"** - Alex Xu
- **[System Design Guide](https://github.com/karanpratapsingh/system-design)** - Karan Pratap Singh
  - Focus on **Chapter V**

**Key Concepts:**
- RESTful API Design Rules
- System architecture patterns
- Scalability principles
- Performance optimization

### Exercise üèóÔ∏è

**Project: Design the System from Your Database Exercise**

Apply your database knowledge to design a complete system:

1. **Architecture Diagram**
   - Component relationships
   - Data flow
   - Technology stack

2. **Estimation and Constraints**
   - User scale estimation
   - Performance requirements
   - Resource constraints

3. **API Design**
   - RESTful endpoints
   - Request/response formats
   - Authentication & authorization

4. **High-Level Design**
   - System components
   - Database design
   - Caching strategy
   - Load balancing

### Additional Resources üìñ

**Practice Problems:**
- **[6 System Design Interview Problems for Practice](https://github.com/karanpratapsingh/system-design)**
- **[LeetDesign](https://leetdesign.com/)** - Interactive system design problems

**Tutorials & Guides:**
- **[GeeksforGeeks System Design Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/system-design-tutorial/)**
- **[Preparing for System Design Interviews](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/preparing-for-the-systems-design-and-coding-interviews/)** - Pragmatic Engineer

## Learning Approach

1. **Study Theory** - Read the recommended books and resources
2. **Practice Design** - Apply concepts to your database project
3. **Solve Problems** - Work through practice problems
4. **Iterate & Improve** - Refine your designs based on feedback

## Key Focus Areas

- **RESTful API Design** - Proper endpoint design and HTTP methods
- **Scalability** - Handle growth and increased load
- **Performance** - Optimize for speed and efficiency
- **Reliability** - Ensure system availability and fault tolerance
- **Security** - Protect data and user privacy
