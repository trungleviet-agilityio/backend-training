# Docker Learning

This section contains comprehensive Docker learning materials and hands-on practice projects, from basic container operations to production-ready multi-service applications.

## 📚 Learning Paths

### 1. 🐳 Practice Projects

#### [Docker Flask Practice](practice/docker-flask-practice/)
Learn Docker fundamentals with a simple Flask application.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Dockerfile basics and image building
- Container lifecycle management
- Docker networking between containers
- Volume management and data persistence
- Basic Docker commands and operations

**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Time:** 2-4 hours

#### [Docker Compose Practice](practice/docker-compose-practice/)
Build a production-ready multi-container application with Flask, Redis, and Nginx.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Multi-service orchestration with Docker Compose
- Service dependencies and health checks
- Environment management (dev/prod)
- Reverse proxy configuration with Nginx
- Production-ready Docker patterns

**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Time:** 4-6 hours

#### [Django Docker Practice](docker-practice/)
A complete Django project demonstrating production-ready Docker containerization and development workflow.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Django with Docker best practices
- Code quality tools (Ruff, Black, isort)
- Pre-commit hooks and GPG commit signing
- Automated CI/CD with PythonAnywhere deployment
- Book management system with comprehensive API

**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Time:** 8-12 hours

### 2. 📖 Shared Resources

#### [Docker Basics](shared/docker/)
Fundamental Docker concepts and operations:
- Getting started with Docker
- Networking concepts
- Volume management
- Best practices

#### [Docker Compose](shared/docker-compose/)
Docker Compose guides and tutorials:
- Getting started with Docker Compose
- Advanced Docker Compose patterns
- Multi-environment configurations
