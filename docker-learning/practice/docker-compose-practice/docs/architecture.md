# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The application is built using a microservices architecture with the following components:

### 1. Flask Application
- RESTful API service
- Redis integration for caching and session management
- Health monitoring endpoints
- Metrics collection

### 2. Redis Service
- In-memory data store
- Session storage
- Cache layer
- Rate limiting
- Job queue

### 3. Nginx Service
- Reverse proxy
- Load balancing
- SSL/TLS termination
- Static file serving
- Security headers

## Component Details

### Flask Application
- Built with Flask 2.3.3
- Uses Gunicorn in production
- Implements health checks
- Integrates with Redis for caching
- Provides RESTful API endpoints

### Redis Configuration
- Uses Redis 7 Alpine
- Persistent storage with AOF
- Health monitoring
- Resource limits
- Backup strategy

### Nginx Configuration
- Optimized for performance
- Security headers
- Gzip compression
- Proxy caching
- Rate limiting

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Set up Python environment
2. Install development dependencies
3. Configure pre-commit hooks
4. Run development server

### Production Deployment
1. Build Docker images
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy with Docker Compose
4. Monitor application health

## Security Considerations

### Application Security
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting

### Infrastructure Security
- Network isolation
- Container security
- Secret management
- Regular updates
- Access control

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Application health
- Redis connection
- Nginx status
- Container health

### Logging
- Structured logging
- Log aggregation
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring

### Backup
- Regular volume backups
- Data persistence
- Recovery procedures
- Backup verification
