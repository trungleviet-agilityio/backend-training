This Docker Compose practice project successfully demonstrates a **production-ready multi-service architecture** with Flask, Redis, and Nginx. The project serves as a comprehensive learning resource for Docker Compose orchestration, container networking, and microservices best practices.

## ✅ Verification Results

### Service Health Check
```bash
$ docker-compose ps
```
```
            Name                         Command                 State             Ports
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
docker-compose-practice_app_1    /entrypoint.sh                 Up (healthy)   5000/tcp
docker-compose-practice_nginx_1  /docker-entrypoint.sh ngin     Up (healthy)   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
docker-compose-practice_redis_1  docker-entrypoint.sh redis     Up (healthy)   6379/tcp
```

**Result**: ✅ All 3 services are running and healthy

### API Endpoint Testing
```bash
$ curl -s http://localhost/ | jq .
```
```json
{
  "message": "Welcome to Docker Compose Practice",
  "visits": 8
}
```

```bash
$ curl -s http://localhost/health | jq .
```
```json
{
  "redis": "connected",
  "status": "UP"
}
```

**Result**: ✅ Both endpoints working correctly, Redis integration functional

### Network Verification
```bash
$ docker network inspect app-network
```
**Network Details**:
- **Name**: `app-network` (not `docker-compose-practice_app-network`)
- **Subnet**: `172.18.0.0/16`
- **Gateway**: `172.18.0.1`
- **Connected Services**:
  - Flask App: `172.18.0.3`
  - Redis: `172.18.0.2`
  - Nginx: `172.18.0.4`

### Container Network Communication
- ✅ Nginx → Flask: Reverse proxy working on `app:5000`
- ✅ Flask → Redis: Database connection established on `redis:6379`
- ✅ Internal DNS resolution: Service names resolving correctly
- ✅ Health checks: All services monitoring their dependencies
- ✅ Network isolation: Services communicate on private `app-network`

### Visit Counter Functionality
- ✅ Atomic increments working (Redis INCR command)
- ✅ Data persistence across requests (current count: 8)
- ✅ Thread-safe operations
- ✅ Container restart resilience (with Redis volume)
