# Chapter 1: Introduction

## üìñ Summary

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of the World Wide Web, web architecture, REST principles, and the foundation for REST API design.

### Historical Context
- The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1990 to facilitate knowledge sharing.
- Berners-Lee created the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the first web server, and the first web browser/editor.
- The Web grew rapidly, leading to scalability challenges and the need for architectural solutions.

### Hello World Wide Web
- **Foundation:** The World Wide Web is built on HTTP and URIs
- **Goal:** Enable distributed hypermedia systems
- **Key Components:** Resources, representations, and state transfer

### Web Architecture

#### Client‚ÄìServer
- **Separation of Concerns:** Client and server are independent
- **Benefits:** Scalability, portability, and evolution
- **Example:** Web browsers (clients) and web servers

#### Uniform Interface
- **Standardized Communication:** Consistent way to interact with resources
- **Components:**
  1. Identification of resources
  2. Manipulation of resources through representations
  3. Self-descriptive messages
  4. Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)

#### Layered System
- **Hierarchical Architecture:** Components can only see the immediate layer
- **Benefits:** Scalability, security, and load balancing
- **Example:** Load balancers, proxies, gateways

#### Cache
- **Explicit Caching:** Responses must define their cacheability
- **Benefits:** Performance, scalability, and user experience
- **Example:** HTTP cache headers (Cache-Control, ETag)

#### Stateless
- **No Session State:** Each request contains all necessary information
- **Benefits:** Scalability, reliability, and simplicity
- **Example:** HTTP requests are independent of each other

#### Code-On-Demand
- **Dynamic Code Execution:** Servers can temporarily extend client functionality
- **Example:** JavaScript execution in web browsers
- **Note:** This is the only optional constraint in the Web's architectural style.

### Web Standards
- **HTTP:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol for communication
- **URIs:** Uniform Resource Identifiers for resource identification
- **HTML:** Hypertext Markup Language for document structure
- **XML/JSON:** Data formats for structured information
- **Standardization:** HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616), URI syntax (RFC 3986)

### REST
- **Definition:** Representational State Transfer
- **Origin:** Coined by Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctoral dissertation
- **Goal:** Provide a standard way for systems to communicate over HTTP
- **Principles:** Based on the architectural constraints of the World Wide Web

### REST APIs
- **Purpose:** Application Programming Interfaces that follow REST principles
- **Characteristics:** Stateless, cacheable, uniform interface
- **Benefits:** Simplicity, scalability, and interoperability
- **Resource Model:** A REST API consists of an assembly of interlinked resources (resource model).
- **RESTful:** Having a REST API makes a web service "RESTful."

### REST API Design
- **Goal:** Create APIs that are easy to use, understand, and maintain
- **Focus:** Resource-oriented design with clear, consistent patterns
- **Importance:** Good design leads to better developer experience and adoption
- **Art vs. Science:** Designing a REST API can feel like an art; rules help bring science and consistency.
- **Common Questions:**
  - When should URI path segments be named with plural nouns?
  - Which request method should be used to update resource state?
  - How do I map non-CRUD operations to my URIs?
  - What is the appropriate HTTP response status code for a given scenario?
  - How can I manage the versions of a resource's state representations?
  - How should I structure a hyperlink in JSON?

### Rules
- **Purpose:** Provide specific guidelines for consistent API design
- **Scope:** Cover URI design, HTTP usage, metadata, and representations
- **Benefits:** Reduce design decisions and improve consistency
- **RFC 2119 Language:** The book uses terms like "must," "should," and "may" as defined in RFC 2119 for clarity and precision in rules.
- **Rule-Oriented Approach:** The book presents rules that can be followed as a complete set or a la carte, but each warrants careful consideration.

### WRML (Web Resource Modeling Language)
- **Purpose:** A conceptual framework and modeling language for REST API design
- **Components:** Resource archetypes, URI patterns, interaction models, media types, and schemas
- **Benefits:** Systematic approach to API design, used for resource modeling and representation examples in later chapters

### Key Principles
1. **Web Architecture Foundation:** REST APIs are built on web architecture principles
2. **Resource-Oriented Design:** Everything is a resource with a unique identifier
3. **Uniform Interface:** Use standard HTTP methods and status codes
4. **Stateless Communication:** Don't maintain session state on the server
5. **Design Rules:** Follow specific rules for consistency and usability

## Review Questions
1. What are the key components of web architecture?
2. What does REST stand for and who created it?
3. What are the six REST architectural constraints?
4. Why is the uniform interface important in REST?
5. What is the difference between stateful and stateless communication?
6. How does caching benefit REST APIs?
7. What is the purpose of the layered system constraint?
8. What are the main web standards that REST APIs rely on?
9. What is WRML and how does it help with API design?
10. Why are design rules important for REST APIs?

## Key Concepts

### Example: Web Architecture Components
```
Client (Browser) ‚Üê‚Üí HTTP ‚Üê‚Üí Server (Web API)
                ‚Üë
            Cache Layer
                ‚Üë
            Load Balancer
```

### Example: Book Figure 1-1 (Web API)
```
Client ‚Üí (Request) ‚Üí Web API ‚Üí Web Service/Backend
Client ‚Üê (Response) ‚Üê Web API
```

### Example: REST Principles in Action
```http
# Resource identification
GET /api/users/123

# Uniform interface (HTTP methods)
POST /api/users
PUT /api/users/123
DELETE /api/users/123

# Stateless communication
Authorization: Bearer token123
Content-Type: application/json
```
