# Chapter 7: Final Thoughts

## ðŸ“– Summary

This chapter provides concluding thoughts on REST API design, discussing the current state of the art, principles for uniform implementation, and recommendations for creating consistent, well-designed APIs. It introduces the WRML conceptual architecture as an alternative approach to REST API implementation.

---

## A. State of the Art

### A.1 Current Framework Limitations
Today, implementing REST API designs is harder than it ought to be. Current tools and frameworks have room for improvement.

#### Framework Origins
- Many programming language-centric REST API development frameworks were originally created for web applications
- Frameworks suggest REST APIs are similar enough to web applications to use the same mold
- Repurpose web application's controller paradigm with URI templates for routing

#### Current Framework Support
- Built-in XML and JSON serialization/deserialization
- URI template routing to handler methods/functions
- No unanimous winner among framework candidates
- Selection based on programming language and platform preference

#### Missing Framework Support
Current frameworks lack direct support for:
- **Natural separation** of resource model from server's implementation model
- **Uniform, cross-format hypermedia structures**
- **Automated HATEOAS** based on current state
- **Media type schema validation and versioning**
- **Partial and dynamically composed response bodies**
- **Integration with client identification and entitlement authority**
- **Multi-origin resource sharing** with JSONP and CORS

#### Developer Dilemma
- **Choice**: Either omit features or code them yourself
- **Alternative**: API management solutions (discussed in Chapter 6)
- **Risk**: Vendor lock-in and lack of transparency
- **Challenge**: Migration between vendors requires standardization

## B. Uniform Implementation

### B.1 Alternative Approach: WRML Conceptual Architecture
The author believes REST APIs should be **designed and configured, not coded**. The WRML conceptual architecture provides an alternative approach founded on architectural principles that align with the book's design rules.

### B.2 Principle: REST API designs differ more than necessary

#### Current State
- REST APIs are ubiquitous but far from uniformly designed
- RESTfulness continues to be debated by creators and consumers
- Absence of standards allows innovation and exploration

#### Future Convergence
- APIs will eventually converge on common patterns for cross-cutting concerns
- Uniformity will likely be driven by pragmatic and detailed standards
- Rule-based expression can lead to detailed specifications

#### Standardization Requirements
- **Language Neutrality**: Must be neutral with respect to programming languages
- **Format Neutrality**: Must be neutral with respect to representation formats
- **Schema Universality**: Schemas can describe data structures without binding to specific formats
- **Reusability**: Schemas and link relations can be shared across organizational boundaries

#### Governance
- **Open Governance**: Success depends on open and nonproprietary governance
- **Web History**: Web has withstood attempts to own or control important parts
- **Vendor Independence**: Avoid vendor lock-in for standardization

### B.3 Principle: A REST API should be designed, not coded

#### Current Coding Approach
- Programming interfaces that expose backend system resources
- Handling HTTP-level details
- Translating backend data model to Web-oriented resource model
- Varies by programming language and framework

#### WRML Alternative: Configuration-Driven Engine
- **Uniform REST API Layer**: Configuration-driven engine within web resource server
- **Request Delegation**: Server accepts requests and delegates to core engine
- **Standardized Design**: Engine design can be consistently implemented across frameworks

#### Step-Oriented Approach
- **Configuration-Based**: Each step and order specified through configuration
- **Common Steps**: Resource template routing, media type negotiation, client authorization, error handling, multi-origin support
- **Context Passing**: Each step receives request context (thread-local associative array)
- **Backend Integration**: Engine connects to backend system to resolve requested resource

#### Backend Interface
- **Minimalistic Interface**: Engine asks backend to fill generic form-oriented structure
- **Schema Instance**: Form is instance of client-negotiated media type's schema
- **State Facts**: Backend provides list of currently true state facts about resource
- **HATEOAS Calculator**: Engine evaluates link formulas using state facts as operands

### B.4 Principle: Programmers and their organizations benefit from consistency

#### Web Development Parallel
- **Browser Uniformity**: HTML elements, CSS presentation, DOM JavaScript API
- **Historical Success**: HTML pages with fields and links as Web's primary type system
- **Consistency Benefits**: Enabled singular and open Web

#### Current REST API State
- **Wild West Analogy**: Not completely lawless, but nearly so
- **Inconsistency Impact**: Hinders transition to next logical architecture
- **Architecture Goal**: Web servers provide structured data, clients handle presentation

#### WRML Architectural Benefits
- **Template Reuse**: Same schema structures as templates and contracts
- **Multi-Device Support**: Frees server developers to focus on business logic
- **Client Framework Development**: New frameworks can abstract HTTP communication
- **Cost Reduction**: Less server-side computational capacity required

### B.5 Principle: A REST API should be created using a GUI tool

#### Goal
- Advance shared REST API design methodology
- Create uniformly programmable Web
- Increase developer productivity through helpful frameworks and tools

#### WRML Design Tool Concept
- **Graphical Design**: Tools allow users to graphically design REST APIs
- **Configuration Generation**: Tool generates structures for web resource server engine
- **Dynamic Loading**: Configuration data can be loaded and reloaded without server restart
- **Nimble Development**: Enables rapid REST API design and development

#### Configuration Architecture
The web resource server engine's configuration data consists of core constructs:

##### API Template
- Named REST API containing:
  - List of resource templates
  - List of schemas
  - List of "global" API-level state facts

##### Resource Template
- Path segment within REST API's hierarchical resource model
- Associated URI template and set of possible schemas
- Clients bind to schemas using media type negotiation
- Schemas must extend base schemas: Document, Collection, Store, Controller

##### Schema
- Like classes or tables: web application's structured types
- Allow forms (instances with fields and links) to be molded in their image
- Used to carry resource state

##### Format
- Elevated to first-class structures (HTML, XML, JSON)
- Can provide links to downloadable code for data exchange
- Help programs exchange encoded data

##### Link Relation
- Concept borrowed from HTML that adds semantics to links
- Documents link's acceptable input media types
- Documents link's possible output media types
