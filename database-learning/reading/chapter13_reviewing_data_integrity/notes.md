# Chapter 13: Reviewing Data Integrity

## 📖 Summary

This chapter represents the final stage of the database design process, focusing on reviewing and refining overall data integrity to ensure the database is sound and complete. The chapter emphasizes the importance of a final integrity review despite careful attention throughout the design process, provides a modular approach to reviewing each component of data integrity (table-level, field-level, relationship-level, and business rules), and covers the assembly of complete database documentation. This final review ensures data consistency, accuracy, and provides peace of mind that the database design is solid before implementation.

## 📝 Guided Notes

### 🎯 Why You Should Review Data Integrity

**Purpose of Final Review:**
- Ensure data integrity is absolutely as sound as possible
- Catch any overlooked issues before implementation
- Provide peace of mind about database design quality
- Prevent inconsistent data or inaccurate information

**Key Principle:** "Garbage in, garbage out!"

**Benefits:**
- Peace of mind from knowing database is solidly designed
- Worth the investment of time and effort
- Prevents problems during implementation
- Ensures data consistency and accuracy

### 🔍 Reviewing and Refining Data Integrity

**Modular Approach:**
- Sequentially review each component of overall data integrity
- Table-level integrity
- Field-level integrity
- Relationship-level integrity
- Business rules
- Views (not directly connected but important to review)

**Expected Outcome:** Very few problems if design method was carefully followed

### 📋 Table-Level Integrity Review

**Check Each Table for Compliance:**

1. **No duplicate fields exist** in the table
2. **No calculated fields exist** in the table
3. **No multivalued fields exist** in the table
4. **No multipart fields exist** in the table
5. **No duplicate records exist** in the table
6. **Every record identified** by a primary key value
7. **Each primary key conforms** to the Elements of a Primary Key

**Reference Chapters:** 6, 7, 8 for resolution techniques

### 🔧 Field-Level Integrity Review

**Ensure Proper Establishment:**

1. **Each field conforms** to the Elements of the Ideal Field
2. **Field specifications defined** for each field

**Reference Chapter:** 9 for resolution techniques

### 🔗 Relationship-Level Integrity Review

**Examine Each Table Relationship:**

1. **Properly established** the relationship
2. **Defined appropriate deletion rules**
3. **Correctly identified type of participation** for each table
4. **Established proper degree of participation** for each table

**Reference Chapter:** 10 for resolution techniques

### 📜 Business Rules Review

**Ensure Sound Business Rules:**

1. **Each rule imposes meaningful constraint**
2. **Proper category determined** for the rule
3. **Properly defined and established** each rule
4. **Modified appropriate field specification elements** or table relationship characteristics
5. **Established appropriate validation tables**
6. **Completed Business Rule Specifications sheet** for each rule

**Reference Chapter:** 11 for resolution techniques

### 👁️ Views Review

**Review All View Structures:**

1. **Each view built on necessary base tables** to provide required information
2. **Appropriate fields assigned** to each view
3. **Each calculated field provides pertinent information** or enhances data presentation
4. **Each filter returns appropriate set** of records
5. **Each view has a view diagram**
6. **Each view diagram accompanied** by a View Specifications sheet

**Reference Chapter:** 12 for resolution techniques

### 📚 Assembling the Database Documentation

**Complete Documentation Repository:**

**Core Documentation:**
- Final table list
- Field Specifications sheets
- Calculated field list
- Table structure diagrams
- Relationship diagrams
- Business Rule Specifications sheets
- View diagrams
- View Specifications sheets

**Additional Items (Optional):**
- Notes compiled during design process
- Samples gathered during analysis stage
- Keep in separate appendix

**Documentation Importance:**

1. **Complete record of database structure**
   - Every aspect of logical structure documented
   - Answer almost any question by referring to documentation

2. **Complete set of specifications and instructions**
   - Similar to architect's blueprints
   - Indicates how database should be constructed
   - Identifies integrity that needs to be established
   - Not directed to particular RDBMS (implementation flexibility)

3. **Modification impact assessment**
   - Determine effects and consequences of modifications
   - Make informed decisions about changes
   - Prevent adverse effects on database structure

### ✅ Done at Last!

**Completion Checklist:**
- ✅ Integrity review completed
- ✅ Documentation assembled
- ✅ Logical database design process complete
- ✅ Properly designed database ready for implementation

**Confidence Level:** Can rest assured that implementation will proceed smoothly
