# Chapter 6: Analyzing the Current Database

## üìñ Summary

This chapter focuses on the critical phase of analyzing the current database environment before designing a new one. The analysis process helps determine whether the existing database supports current information requirements, uncovers structural deficiencies, and identifies how the database needs to evolve to support future requirements. The chapter emphasizes that while the current database can serve as a resource, it should never be adopted as the basis for the new structure. The analysis involves three main steps: reviewing how data is collected, reviewing how information is presented, and conducting comprehensive interviews with users and management.

## üìù Guided Notes

### Getting to Know the Current Database

**The Philosophy Behind Analysis**
- "To determine where you should go, you must first understand where you are"
- Analysis helps determine if current database supports organization's information requirements
- Uncovers existing structural deficiencies
- Determines how database needs to evolve for future requirements

**Key Questions to Answer**
- What types of data does the organization use?
- How does the organization use that data?
- How does the organization manage and maintain that data?

**Types of Current Databases**

1. **Paper-based Databases (File Systems)**
   - Various forms and handwritten/printed documents
   - Stored in file folders or notebooks with coding schemes
   - Many businesses still use some form of paper-based system
   - Contains inconsistent, erroneous, duplicate, redundant, incomplete, and old data

2. **Legacy Databases**
   - In existence and use for 5+ years
   - Various data structures and user interfaces
   - Reside on mainframes, network servers, PCs, or cloud
   - Often improperly or inefficiently designed
   - May have duplicate fields and redundant data

3. **Human Knowledge Bases**
   - Based on memory of one or more employees
   - Individuals have specific knowledge about organization aspects
   - Crucial to conducting organization's business

**Critical Rule**
- **DO NOT adopt the current database structure as the basis for the new database structure**
- Hidden problems will transfer to new database
- Always define new database structure explicitly

### Conducting the Analysis

**Three-Step Analysis Process**
1. Review how data is collected
2. Review how information is presented
3. Conduct interviews with users and management

### Looking at How Data Is Collected

**Paper-Based Items Review**
- Find all documents used to record data
- Gather single sample of each type
- Store samples in organized folder
- Look for complete entries as examples

**Computer Programs Review**
- Review all programs used to collect data
- Gather screenshots representing data collection
- Watch for creative use of common programs (word processors, spreadsheets)
- Create screenshots with program name and date
- Store in organized folder

**Web Pages Review**
- Examine web pages used for data collection
- Look for data entry forms similar to database applications
- Take screenshots with URL, program name, and date
- Store in organized folder

### Looking at How Information Is Presented

**Three Popular Presentation Methods**

1. **Reports**
   - Any document used to arrange and present data meaningfully
   - Generated by word processors, spreadsheets, or other software
   - Some still written by hand

2. **Screen Presentations (Slide Shows)**
   - Series of slides discussing various topics
   - Created with PowerPoint, Google Slides, Keynote
   - Review only those with direct bearing on database data

3. **Web Pages**
   - Information available via organization websites
   - Used similarly to reports
   - Review only those drawing directly from database

**Review Process**
- Identify and review each report generated from database
- Gather samples and assemble in folder
- Review screen presentations that use database data
- Review web pages that draw from database
- Work with website developers for guidance

### Conducting Interviews

**Why Interviews Are Critical**
- Provide details about assembled samples
- Provide information on how organization uses data
- Instrumental in defining preliminary field and table structures
- Help define future information requirements
- **Cannot overemphasize their impact on final database structure**

**Basic Interview Techniques**

**The Importance of Questions**
- Learning to ask questions is a valuable skill
- Essential for understanding how business works
- Required for gathering information throughout design process

**The Interview Process**
- Use both open-ended and closed questions
- Open-ended: general, focus on specific subjects
- Closed: specific, focus on particular details
- Start with open-ended, then move to specific follow-up questions

**Subject-Identification Technique**
- Listen for nouns in responses
- Subjects represent person, place, thing, or event
- Ignore nouns representing characteristics
- List subjects for further discussion
- Example: "Account Representative," "Clients," "Appointment," "Sales Order"

**Characteristic-Identification Technique**
- Listen for nouns representing characteristics of subjects
- Usually in singular form ("phone number," "address")
- Contrast with possessive form ("the client's phone number")
- List characteristics separately from subjects
- Example: "Name," "Address," "Phone Number," "Email Address"

### Interviewing Users

**Four Issues to Address**
1. Types of data users are currently using
2. How users are currently using their data
3. Collection of samples assembled during analysis
4. Types of information users require for daily work

**Reviewing Data Type and Usage**
- Discuss first two issues together
- Start with open-ended questions about daily work
- Use Subject-Identification and Characteristic-Identification techniques
- Focus on data vs. information distinction

**Reviewing the Samples**
- Identify how samples are used
- Clarify aspects you don't understand
- Assign description to each sample
- Write clear, concise descriptions
- Handle complex samples (multiple subjects) carefully

**Reviewing Information Requirements**

**Current Information Requirements**
- Review report samples
- Determine data origin for each report
- Identify if user creates/maintains report data
- If not, identify data source

**Additional Information Requirements**
- Review reports for missing information
- Have users note additional information needed
- Identify new subjects or characteristics
- Review concerns about user suggestions

**Future Information Requirements**
- Consider organization evolution
- Help users envision future scenarios
- Use questions to focus thoughts on future needs
- Create sketches of new reports
- Account for speculative nature of responses

### Interviewing Management

**Four Issues to Address**
1. Types of information managers currently receive
2. Types of additional information they need
3. Types of information they foresee needing
4. Perception of organization's overall information requirements

**Reviewing Current Information Requirements**
- Identify routine information received
- Determine if reports missing from samples
- Use Subject-Identification technique for new subjects
- Add new reports to collection

**Reviewing Additional Information Requirements**
- Review report samples for missing information
- Have managers note additional information needed
- Identify new subjects or characteristics
- Review and resolve concerns

**Reviewing Future Information Requirements**
- Consider organization evolution
- Focus on decision-making and guidance needs
- Create sketches of new reports
- Account for speculative nature

**Reviewing Overall Information Requirements**
- Review all reports gathered
- Consider information useful to organization
- Identify information not currently received
- Create sketches for new information needs

### Compiling a Complete List of Fields

**The Preliminary Field List**
- Represents organization's fundamental data requirements
- Core set of fields to define in database
- Created using two-step process

**Step 1: Review and Refine the List of Characteristics**

**Refining Items with the Same Name**
- Look for items with same name
- Determine if they represent same characteristic
- Cross out duplicates if same
- Rename if different subjects (e.g., "Name" ‚Üí "Client Name," "Employee Name")

**Refining Items Representing the Same Characteristic**
- Look for items representing same characteristic
- Choose clearest, most complete name
- Cross out duplicates
- Example: "Product #," "Product No.," "Product Number" ‚Üí "Product Number"

**Ensuring Items Represent Characteristics**
- Test each item with questions:
  - Can this word describe something?
  - Does this represent a component/detail/piece?
  - Does this represent a collection?
  - Does this represent something that can be broken down?
- Move subjects to subjects list
- Identify characteristics for new subjects

**Step 2: Determine New Characteristics in Samples**
- Highlight characteristics on each sample
- Cross out if already on Preliminary Field List
- Cross out if same meaning as existing field
- Add remaining characteristics to list
- Rename generic items appropriately

**Value Lists**
- Record characteristics with value lists
- Note the values within each list
- For large lists, write description and min/max values
- Set aside for field specifications and business rules
- Focus on distinct, specific value sets

**The Calculated Field List**
- Remove calculated fields from Preliminary Field List
- Place on separate Calculated Field List
- Look for names containing: amount, total, sum, average, minimum, maximum, count
- Common examples: "Subtotal," "Average Age," "Discount Amount"

**Reviewing Both Lists**
- Conduct brief interviews with users and management
- Determine if fields omitted from either list
- Add missing fields to appropriate list
- Verify completeness of lists
