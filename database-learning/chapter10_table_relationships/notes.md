# Chapter 10: Table Relationships

## üìñ Summary

This chapter covers the crucial process of identifying and establishing relationships between tables in a database. Relationships are fundamental to relational database design as they establish logical connections between related data, enable data retrieval from multiple tables, and ensure relationship-level integrity. The chapter explains the three main types of relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many), self-referencing relationships, the process of identifying existing relationships using a table matrix, establishing relationships through primary and foreign keys or linking tables, and defining relationship characteristics including deletion rules, participation types, and degrees of participation.

## üìù Guided Notes

### üéØ Why Relationships Are Important

**Four Critical Reasons:**

1. **Establish logical connections between related data**
   - Connect tables that are logically related via the data they contain
   - Enable meaningful associations between different subjects/objects
   - Example: STUDENTS table logically related to STUDENT INSTRUMENTS table

2. **Refine table structures and minimize redundant data**
   - Minor modifications to table structures during relationship establishment
   - Make structures more efficient and eliminate redundant data
   - Improve overall database design quality

3. **Enable data retrieval from multiple tables simultaneously**
   - Mechanism for drawing data from multiple tables at once
   - Foundation for creating views and complex queries
   - Essential for meaningful information presentation

4. **Ensure relationship-level integrity**
   - Guarantee reliable and sound relationships
   - Component of overall data integrity
   - Prevent problems with insert, update, delete operations

**Key Benefits:**
- Properly defined relationships enable relational database benefits
- Careful establishment prevents data integrity problems
- Sound relationships facilitate efficient data operations

### üîó Types of Relationships

**Three Main Types:**

#### 1. One-to-One Relationships
**Definition:** Single record in first table related to only one record in second table, and vice versa

**Characteristics:**
- Usually involves subset tables
- Can involve security/privacy considerations
- Example: EMPLOYEES and COMPENSATION tables

**Diagramming:** Simple line between tables

**Establishment:** Primary key from parent table becomes foreign key in child table

#### 2. One-to-Many Relationships
**Definition:** Single record in first table can be related to one or more records in second table, but single record in second table can be related to only one record in first table

**Characteristics:**
- Most common relationship type
- Easiest to identify
- Crucial for data integrity
- Eliminates duplicate data and minimizes redundancy

**Diagramming:** Crow's foot symbol on "many" side

**Establishment:** Primary key from "one" side becomes foreign key on "many" side

**Example:** CUSTOMERS and CUSTOMER RENTALS tables

#### 3. Many-to-Many Relationships
**Definition:** Single record in first table can be related to one or more records in second table, and single record in second table can be related to one or more records in first table

**Characteristics:**
- Second most common relationship type
- More difficult to identify than one-to-many
- Requires careful examination of table structures

**Problems with Many-to-Many Relationships:**
- Difficult to associate records between tables
- Tedious information retrieval
- Large amount of redundant data
- Duplicate data in both tables
- Difficult insert, update, delete operations

**Common Incorrect Solutions:**
1. **Multiple field copies** - Incorporating field multiple times in one table
2. **Single field incorporation** - Taking fields from one table into another

**Proper Solution:** Use linking table to establish relationship

**Diagramming:** Crow's foot symbols on both sides

### üîÑ Self-Referencing Relationships

**Definition:** Relationship that exists between records within a single table

**Types:**
1. **One-to-One** - Given record related to only one other record
2. **One-to-Many** - Given record related to one or more other records
3. **Many-to-Many** - Given record related to multiple records and vice versa

**Establishment:**
- **One-to-One/One-to-Many:** Primary key and foreign key in same table
- **Many-to-Many:** Linking table with fields from same parent table

**Considerations:**
- Can be tedious to retrieve information
- May indicate need for new field/table structures
- Should serve useful purpose

### üîç Identifying Existing Relationships

**Process Overview:**
1. Create table matrix
2. Work with users and management
3. Ask appropriate questions
4. Use relationship formulas
5. Diagram relationships

**Table Matrix Creation:**
- List tables across top and down left side
- Same order for both dimensions
- Work systematically through matrix
- Look for direct relationships only

**Two Types of Questions:**

#### 1. Associative Questions
**Format:** "Can a single record in (first table) be associated with one or more records in (second table)?"

**Self-referencing modification:** "Can a single (singular form) be associated with one or more (plural form)?"

**Example:** "Can a single record in CLASSES be associated with one or more records in BUILDINGS?"

#### 2. Contextual Questions
**Two Categories:**

**a) Ownership-oriented:**
- Include words: own, has, is part of, contain
- Example: "Can a single order contain one or more products?"

**b) Action-oriented:**
- Include action verbs: make, visit, place, teach, attend
- Example: "Does a single flight instructor teach one or more types of classes?"

**Relationship Formulas:**
- 1:1 + 1:1 = 1:1 (One-to-one relationship)
- 1:N + 1:1 = 1:N (One-to-many relationship)
- 1:N + 1:N = M:N (Many-to-many relationship)

**Procedure for Official Relationship:**
1. Select pair of tables and note junction entry
2. Locate second table and note opposite junction entry
3. Apply appropriate formula
4. Diagram relationship
5. Cross out both entries on matrix

### üèóÔ∏è Establishing Each Relationship

#### One-to-One and One-to-Many Relationships
**Method:** Use primary key and foreign key

**Process:**
1. Take copy of parent table's primary key
2. Incorporate into child table structure
3. Designate as foreign key
4. Update relationship diagram

**Parent/Child Role Assignment:**
- Usually depends on subjects represented
- Child table must have related record in parent table
- Subset tables usually assigned child role

**Example:** STAFF (parent) and COMPENSATION (child) tables

#### Many-to-Many Relationships
**Method:** Use linking table

**Three-Step Procedure:**
1. **Define linking table** - Take copies of primary keys from both tables
2. **Name linking table** - Represent nature of relationship
3. **Add to table list** - Proper entries for type and description

**Results of Linking Table:**
- Original many-to-many relationship dissolved
- Replaced by two one-to-many relationships
- Linking table contains two foreign keys
- Composite primary key in linking table
- Minimal redundant data

**Example:** STUDENTS and CLASSES ‚Üí STUDENT CLASSES linking table

#### Self-Referencing Relationships
**One-to-One and One-to-Many:**
- Primary key and foreign key in same table
- Foreign key often already exists in structure
- Create new foreign key if needed

**Many-to-Many:**
- Use linking table with fields from same parent table
- Example: PARTS table ‚Üí PART COMPONENTS linking table

### üîß Refining All Foreign Keys

**Elements of a Foreign Key:**

#### 1. Same Name as Parent Primary Key
**Rule:** Foreign key should have same name as primary key from which it was copied

**Exceptions:** Only for compelling reasons (e.g., self-referencing relationships)

**Benefits:**
- No ambiguity about foreign key validity
- Clear relationship identification
- Saves time on testing and verification

#### 2. Replica Field Specifications
**General Elements Modifications:**
- **Specification Type:** Set to "Replica"
- **Parent Table:** Foreign key's parent table name
- **Source Specification:** Parent primary key name (include table name)
- **Description:** Indicate foreign key's purpose within table

**Logical Elements Modifications:**
- **Key Type:** Set to "Foreign"
- **Uniqueness:** Set to "Non-unique" (except one-to-one relationships)
- **Values Entered By:** Set to "User"
- **Range of Values:** Only existing values from parent primary key
- **Edit Rule:** Usually "Enter Now, Edits Allowed"

#### 3. Values from Parent Primary Key
**Rule:** Foreign key must draw values exclusively from parent primary key

**Benefits:**
- Ensures consistency between tables
- Establishes relationship-level integrity
- Prevents invalid foreign key values

### üéõÔ∏è Establishing Relationship Characteristics

#### 1. Deletion Rules
**Purpose:** Determine what happens when deleting parent table record

**Five Types:**

**a) Deny (D):**
- RDBMS keeps record but designates as "inactive"
- Use when: Cannot delete employee record, must mark inactive

**b) Restrict (R):**
- RDBMS prevents deletion if related records exist
- Must delete child records first
- Use as matter of course

**c) Cascade (C):**
- RDBMS deletes parent record and all related child records
- Use when: Delete employee and all associated orders

**d) Nullify (N):**
- RDBMS deletes parent record and sets foreign keys to Null
- Requires Null Support = "Nulls Allowed"

**e) Set Default (S):**
- RDBMS deletes parent record and sets foreign keys to default value
- Requires default value setting

**Question Format:** "When a record in (parent table) is deleted, what should happen to related records in (child table)?"

#### 2. Type of Participation
**Two Types:**

**a) Mandatory:**
- At least one record must exist before entering related records
- Symbol: Vertical line (|)

**b) Optional:**
- No requirement for records to exist before entering related records
- Symbol: Circle (‚óã)

**Determination Factors:**
- Obvious circumstances
- Common sense
- Conformance to standards
- Business rules

#### 3. Degree of Participation
**Format:** (minimum, maximum) numbers

**Examples:**
- (1,1): Exactly one record required
- (0,15): No minimum, maximum of 15
- (0,N): No minimum, unlimited maximum

**Determination Factors:**
- Same as type of participation
- Business policies and requirements
- Organizational standards

**Unlimited Participation:** Use "N" for maximum number

### üîç Verifying Table Relationships

**Checklist:**
1. Properly identified each relationship
2. Properly established each relationship
3. Foreign keys comply with Elements of a Foreign Key
4. Appropriate deletion rule for each relationship
5. Proper type of participation for each table
6. Proper degree of participation for each table

**Review Process:**
- Work with users and management
- Use checklist systematically
- Verify all relationships
- Ensure agreement on assessment

### üõ°Ô∏è Relationship-Level Integrity

**Definition:** Relationship attains integrity after proper establishment and characteristic setting

**Four Warranties:**

1. **Sound connection between tables**
   - Accomplished through primary/foreign keys or linking tables
   - Proper relationship establishment

2. **Meaningful record insertion**
   - Appropriate type of participation designation
   - Clear insertion rules

3. **Safe record deletion**
   - Appropriate deletion rule assignment
   - No adverse effects from deletion

4. **Meaningful relationship limits**
   - Appropriate degree of participation designation
   - Clear relationship boundaries

**Component of Overall Data Integrity:**
