## Practice Project: TV Company Database System

### Project Overview
A practical database design and implementation project for a TV company's series management system.

### Project Requirements
The system needs to store and manage:
- TV series information
- Actors and their roles
- Directors and their episodes
- Episode transmission schedules
- Employment records

### Project Steps

#### 1. E/R Modeling
- [ ] Analyze requirements
- [ ] Identify entities and relationships
  - TV Series
  - Actors
  - Directors
  - Episodes
  - Transmissions
- [ ] Define attributes and primary keys
- [ ] Create E/R diagram
- [ ] Document entity relationships and cardinality

#### 2. Relational Database Design
- [ ] Convert E/R model to relational schema
- [ ] Define tables and relationships
- [ ] Create SQL DDL commands for:
  - Table creation
  - Primary key constraints
  - Foreign key constraints
  - Other necessary constraints

#### 3. Database Implementation
- [ ] Set up database environment
- [ ] Execute SQL DDL commands
- [ ] Verify table structure
- [ ] Test constraints

#### 4. Data Population
- [ ] Create data generation script
  - Choose implementation language (Python/JavaScript/Shell)
  - Design data generation logic
  - Implement 1000 records generation
- [ ] Execute data population
- [ ] Verify data integrity

#### 5. Query Implementation
Implement and test the following queries:
- [ ] List actors in "Big Sister" series
- [ ] Find series featuring actor "Bertil Bom"
- [ ] Identify actors in multiple series
- [ ] Count transmissions of "Wild Lies" first episode
- [ ] Count total directors
- [ ] Find director with most episodes

### Project Deliverables
1. E/R diagram
2. SQL DDL scripts
3. Data generation script
4. Query implementation scripts
5. Query results documentation

### Learning Outcomes
- Practical E/R modeling
- Relational database design
- SQL implementation
- Data generation techniques
- Complex query writing
- Database documentation

## Resources
- Database Design Book (provided)
- Online tutorials and documentation
- Practice exercises and projects

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Complete DBMS fundamentals
- [ ] Master database design principles
- [ ] Implement sample databases
- [ ] Complete practical exercises

## Notes
- Keep track of important concepts and examples
- Practice with real-world scenarios
- Document your learning journey
- Review and revise regularly

## Next Steps
1. Start with DBMS fundamentals
2. Move to database design concepts
3. Practice with SQL
4. Implement sample projects

Remember to:
- Take notes while reading
- Practice concepts with examples
- Build small projects to reinforce learning
- Review and revise regularly
