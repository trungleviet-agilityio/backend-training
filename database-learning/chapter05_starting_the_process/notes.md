# Chapter 5: Starting the Process

## 📖 Summary

This chapter marks the true beginning of the database design process, focusing on the foundational steps: conducting interviews, defining the mission statement, and defining the mission objectives. The chapter emphasizes that the process starts by clarifying the end result—what the database is for and what tasks it must support. Interviews are highlighted as a critical tool for gathering requirements and building trust with stakeholders. The chapter provides practical guidelines for effective interviews, explains how to craft a clear mission statement, and details how to derive actionable mission objectives from stakeholder input. These steps set the direction for the entire design process and ensure the final database structure meets real organizational needs.

## 📝 Guided Notes

### Conducting Interviews
- **Purpose:** Interviews connect the developer with users, management, and owners to gather requirements and clarify needs.
- **Types:** Can be with individuals, groups, or even "self-interviews" for solo projects.
- **Modern context:** Remote interviews via platforms like Zoom, Teams, etc., are now common.
- **Why interviews matter:**
  - Provide critical information for design decisions
  - Help clarify ambiguous requirements
  - Build trust and encourage participation
  - Ensure all perspectives are considered
- **Guidelines for participants:**
  - Explain the purpose and format of the interview
  - Reassure participants that their input is valued and not an assessment
  - Show appreciation for their time and feedback
  - Clarify that the developer is the final arbitrator for design disputes
- **Guidelines for interviewers:**
  - Choose an appropriate meeting platform
  - Limit the number of participants for better engagement
  - Conduct separate interviews for users and management to avoid conflicts and leverage unique perspectives
  - Prepare open-ended questions in advance
  - Take thorough notes or record the session (with permission)
  - Give equal attention to all participants
  - Be patient with vague answers and encourage elaboration
  - Keep the interview focused and moving
  - Maintain control and diplomatically handle dominant participants
- **Open-ended questions:** Encourage detailed, thoughtful responses (e.g., "How would you describe your daily work?")
- **Example interview scenario:** See the book for sample dialogues and how to extract mission statements/objectives from responses.

### Defining the Mission Statement
- **Definition:** A succinct statement describing the specific purpose of the database.
- **Why it matters:**
  - Provides focus and direction for design
  - Prevents unnecessary complexity
  - Ensures all stakeholders agree on the database's purpose
- **Characteristics of a good mission statement:**
  - Succinct and to the point
  - Free of specific tasks or implementation details
  - Clear and unambiguous
  - Understood and agreed upon by all stakeholders
- **How to create:**
  - Interview the owner/manager to understand the organization's purpose and needs
  - Use open-ended questions to elicit broad, purpose-focused responses
  - Rewrite responses into a single, clear sentence
  - Review and refine with stakeholders
- **Example:**
  - Poor: "Keep track of applications, hearings, decisions, appeals, employees, and office data."
  - Good: "Maintain the data needed to support the decision-making process for land-use requests."

### Defining the Mission Objectives
- **Definition:** Declarative statements representing the general tasks the database must support.
- **Why they matter:**
  - Guide the design of tables, fields, relationships, and business rules
  - Ensure the database structure supports all necessary tasks
  - Help maintain focus and avoid scope creep
- **Characteristics of good mission objectives:**
  - Each represents a single, general task
  - Succinct, clear, and free of unnecessary detail
  - Expressed as declarative sentences
  - Derived from both explicit and implicit information in interviews
- **How to create:**
  - Interview users and management about their daily work and data needs
  - Ask open-ended questions about tasks, reports, and data they use
  - Record responses as declarative sentences
  - Look for implicit needs ("reading between the lines")
  - Review and refine with stakeholders
- **Examples:**
  - Maintain complete inventory information
  - Track all customer sales
  - Maintain complete supplier and employee information
- **Tip:** If a mission objective contains more than one task, split it into multiple objectives.

## 💡 Reflection
- Why is it important to start the design process by defining the end result?
- How can well-conducted interviews improve the quality of your database design?
- What risks arise from poorly defined mission statements or objectives?
- How can you ensure you capture both explicit and implicit requirements during interviews?
