- **1:N**: Row table has one, column table has many (e.g., TVSeries 1:N Episode)
- **N:1**: Row table has many, column table has one (e.g., Episode N:1 TVSeries)
- **N:1\***: Episode.director_id â†’ Employee.id (each episode has one director, an employee)

> **Note:** All M:N relationships in the logical model are implemented as two 1:N relationships via linking (junction) tables in the physical schema. For example, EmployeeSeriesRole links Employee and TVSeries with two 1:N relationships.

## 3. Notes & Best Practices
- All primary keys are UUIDs for global uniqueness.
- All foreign keys are explicitly defined.
- Composite primary keys are used in linking tables for M:N relationships.
- Soft delete (`deleted` boolean) is used for logical deletion.
- All tables include `created_time` and `updated_time` timestamps.
- Field specifications (type, nullability, uniqueness, description) follow best practices from chapters 8â€“10.
