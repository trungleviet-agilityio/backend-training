- **1:N**: Row table has one, column table has many (e.g., TVSeries 1:N Episode)
- **N:1**: Row table has many, column table has one (e.g., Episode N:1 TVSeries)
- **N:1\***: Episode.director_uuid â†’ Employee.uuid (each episode has one director, an employee)

> **Note:** All M:N relationships in the logical model are implemented as two 1:N relationships via linking (junction) tables in the physical schema. For example, EmployeeSeriesRole links Employee and TVSeries with two 1:N relationships.

## 3. Notes & Best Practices
- All primary keys are UUIDs for global uniqueness.
- All foreign keys are explicitly defined.
- Composite primary keys are used in linking tables for M:N relationships.
- Soft delete (`deleted` boolean) is used for logical deletion.
- All tables include `created_time` and `updated_time` timestamps.
- Field specifications (type, nullability, uniqueness, description) follow best practices from chapters 8â€“10.
- Use BIGINT for viewership to support global platforms.
- Use TIMESTAMPTZ for all timestamps that may be global (e.g., transmission_time, audit logs).
- TVSeries.title and Episode.title are not unique; use composite keys or UUIDs for uniqueness.
- Channel is a validation table for allowed transmission channels; Transmission.channel_uuid must reference Channel.uuid (FK).
- Employee.status supports reporting and admin logic (active, on_leave, terminated).
- Consider using a ValidationLog or AuditLog table for tracking changes, editors, and reasons.
