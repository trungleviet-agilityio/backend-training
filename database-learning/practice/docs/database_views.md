## 7. Security Considerations

### 7.1. Access Control
- **Production Views:** Access for production staff only
- **HR Views:** Access for HR personnel and management
- **Analytics Views:** Access for analytics team and management
- **Management Views:** Access for executive management only

### 7.2. Data Filtering
- All views automatically filter out deleted records
- Employee views respect status-based access (active employees only)
- Sensitive information (birthdates, emails) restricted to appropriate views

### 7.3. Row-Level Security
- Consider implementing row-level security for multi-tenant scenarios
- Department-based access control for organizational data
- Role-based access for employee information

---

## 8. Performance Considerations

### 8.1. Indexing Strategy
- Index foreign key columns used in view joins
- Index date columns for time-based filtering
- Index status columns for active record filtering

### 8.2. Materialized Views
- Consider materializing frequently accessed views
- Refresh strategies for real-time vs. batch updates
- Storage considerations for large datasets

### 8.3. Query Optimization
- Use appropriate join types (INNER vs LEFT)
- Limit result sets with WHERE clauses
- Consider pagination for large result sets
