# ðŸ“œ Business Rules for TV Company Database

---

## 1. Introduction
This document defines all business rules for the TV company database system, organized by table and field. Rules are based on project requirements and best practices from database design literature (see chapters 9, 10, 11, and 13). Rules are categorized as database-oriented (enforced by schema/constraints) or application-oriented (enforced by application logic).

## 3. General Business Rules
- All tables: No duplicate records (enforced by PK/unique constraints)
- All tables: Soft delete only, never hard delete
- All tables: created_time and updated_time must be set and maintained
- All FKs: Must reference non-deleted records (application logic; referential integrity must be maintained for active data)
- All queries: Must filter out deleted records unless explicitly required
- All validation fields: Must reference values in validation tables (e.g., domains, roles, departments, channels)
- **Multi-channel Broadcasting:** Transmissions can be broadcast on multiple channels simultaneously through the TransmissionChannel linking table
- **Global Support:** Transmission times use TIMESTAMPTZ for timezone support, viewership uses BIGINT for global scale
- **Indexing:** Indexes should be created on frequently joined or filtered fields (e.g., series_id, episode_id, role_id, employee_id, transmission_id, channel_id) to support efficient queries and reporting.
- **Reporting/Analytics:**
  - It must be possible to answer:
    - Which actors play in a given series (e.g., "Big Sister")
    - In which series a given actor (e.g., "Bertil Bom") participates
    - Which actors participate in more than one series
    - How many times (and when) an episode was transmitted
    - How many directors are employed by the company
    - Which director has directed the greatest number of episodes
    - **New Multi-channel Queries:**
      - Which channels broadcast a specific episode
      - How many channels broadcast each transmission
      - Which episodes were broadcast on multiple channels simultaneously
      - Channel performance comparison (viewership by channel)
      - Global transmission reach (total viewership across all channels)
