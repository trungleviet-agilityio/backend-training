## 4. Table Structure Validation

### 4.1. Subject-Verb-Noun Analysis
Each table represents a single subject:

- **SeriesDomain** â†’ "A domain/genre of television content"
- **TVSeries** â†’ "A television series"
- **Episode** â†’ "An episode of a television series"
- **Transmission** â†’ "A transmission/broadcast of an episode"
- **Channel** â†’ "A broadcasting channel/platform"
- **Employee** â†’ "An actor or director employed by the TV company"
- **Role** â†’ "A role/job function (Actor, Director, etc.)"
- **Department** â†’ "A department in the company"

### 4.2. Field Relevance Check
All fields in each table are directly related to the table's subject:

- **TVSeries** fields all describe characteristics of a television series
- **Episode** fields all describe characteristics of an episode
- **Employee** fields all describe characteristics of an actor or director
- **Transmission** fields all describe characteristics of a transmission

### 4.3. Duplicate Field Elimination
No duplicate fields exist across tables:
- Each field appears only once in the database
- Related fields (like names) are properly contextualized
- Foreign keys are clearly identified and properly named

## 5. Primary Key Establishment

### 5.1. Single-Field Primary Keys
- **SeriesDomain.uuid**: UUID, auto-generated
- **TVSeries.uuid**: UUID, auto-generated
- **Episode.uuid**: UUID, auto-generated
- **Transmission.uuid**: UUID, auto-generated
- **Channel.uuid**: UUID, auto-generated
- **Employee.uuid**: UUID, auto-generated
- **Role.uuid**: UUID, auto-generated
- **Department.uuid**: UUID, auto-generated
- **SeriesCast.uuid**: UUID, auto-generated

### 5.2. Composite Primary Keys
- **TransmissionChannel**: (transmission_uuid, channel_uuid)
- **SeriesCast**: (employee_uuid, series_uuid, role_uuid) UNIQUE constraint

### 5.3. Primary Key Characteristics
- **Uniqueness**: All primary keys are guaranteed unique
- **Stability**: UUIDs remain stable throughout record lifecycle
- **Simplicity**: Simple, single-purpose identifiers
- **Non-intelligence**: No business meaning embedded in keys
