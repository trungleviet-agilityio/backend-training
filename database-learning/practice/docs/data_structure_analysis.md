- **Solution**: Application-level constraint + database trigger

#### 2. **Director Role Validation**
- **Issue**: Episode directors must have appropriate role
- **Solution**: Application-level validation + database trigger

#### 3. **Character Name Requirements**
- **Issue**: Character names required for Actor roles
- **Solution**: Application-level validation

#### 4. **Multi-Channel Broadcasting**
- **Issue**: Complex transmission scheduling
- **Solution**: Linking table with proper constraints

## üîß Performance Considerations

### Indexing Strategy

#### **Primary Indexes**
- All primary keys (automatic)
- Foreign key columns for join performance

#### **Composite Indexes**
- `series_cast(employee_uuid, series_uuid, role_uuid)` for unique constraint
- `episodes(series_uuid, episode_number)` for episode ordering
- `transmissions(episode_uuid, transmission_time)` for scheduling

#### **Single-Column Indexes**
- `tv_series.domain_uuid` for domain filtering
- `episodes.director_uuid` for director queries
- `transmissions.transmission_time` for time-based queries

### Query Optimization

#### **High-Frequency Queries**
1. **Series with episodes**: Join TVSeries ‚Üí Episodes
2. **Employee participation**: Join Employees ‚Üí SeriesCast ‚Üí TVSeries
3. **Transmission scheduling**: Join Episodes ‚Üí Transmissions ‚Üí TransmissionChannel ‚Üí Channels
4. **Director assignments**: Join Episodes ‚Üí Employees

#### **Performance Hotspots**
- Transmission data queries (high volume)
- Multi-channel broadcasting lookups
- Employee participation across multiple series

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Integrity Measures

#### **Database-Level Constraints**
- Foreign key relationships
- Unique constraints
- Check constraints for data validation

#### **Application-Level Constraints**
- Business rule validation
- Complex relationship validation
- Soft delete operations

#### **Trigger-Based Enforcement**
